My name is Jacob!
I have here my professional portfolio/ personal projects.
I graduated from the University of Washington, Bothell with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering.
I minored in mathematics and computer science and software engineering.
I am interested in digital and embedded control systems and digital/analog systems.
I enjoy music, baking, digital art (check out my redbubble: https://www.redbubble.com/people/JacobDrawsSoup/),
  calligraphy, photography, table top board games, creative writing, crochet, jewelry making, and probably other
  things too.
 
 Currently working on: Eurorack module for simple synthesis using samples.
